# RoboArms-Edu
A software repo for controlling, simulating, visualising robot arms and generating practice problems for robot kinematics educational projects. 

Aims include using C/C++, Python, Rust, Julia to represent traditional, modern &amp; up-and-coming languages; creating practice problems so that users can learn interactively and with strong information; and improving the physical arms we use as we go, to provide both cheap models to build at home and more advanced models making use of electronic components and software concepts indispensible to solving both industrial and human problems
