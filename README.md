# RoboArms-Edu
A software repo for controlling, simulating, visualising robot arms and generating practice problems for robot kinematics educational projects. 

## Aims include... ##
---------------
* using C/C++, Python, Rust, Julia to represent traditional, modern &amp; up-and-coming languages; 
* creating practice problems so that users can learn interactively and with strong information; 
* improving the physical arms we use as we go, to provide cheap, build-at-home models and more advanced designs with components and software indispensible to solving both industrial and human problems
